## üíª Code Samples to Highlight

### 1. Database Security Implementation
```java
// Password hashing with salt
public static String hashPassword(String password, String salt) {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
    md.update(Base64.getDecoder().decode(salt));
    byte[] hashedPassword = md.digest(password.getBytes());
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hashedPassword);
}
```

### 2. Data Validation Framework
```java
// Comprehensive input validation
public static ValidationResult validateWeight(String weightText) {
    double weight = Double.parseDouble(weightText.trim());
    if (weight < MIN_WEIGHT || weight > MAX_WEIGHT) {
        return new ValidationResult(false, 
            String.format("Weight must be between %.1f and %.1f kg", 
            MIN_WEIGHT, MAX_WEIGHT));
    }
    return new ValidationResult(true, "Weight is valid");
}
```

### 3. Professional Error Handling
```java
// Centralized error management
public static void handleDatabaseError(Component parent, SQLException e, String operation) {
    logger.severe(String.format("Database error [%s]: %s", operation, e.getMessage()));
    String userMessage = getDatabaseErrorMessage(e);
    showErrorDialog(parent, userMessage, "Database Error");
}
```
